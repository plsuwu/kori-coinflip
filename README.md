# kori coinflip

doesnt work yet, but could be funny

## usage

reminder that this doesnt actually work yet

however:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plsuwu/kori-coinflip
cd kori-coinflip
bun run build
```

and then import the `dist` directory as a chrome extension (please jjust google this its 4am...).
